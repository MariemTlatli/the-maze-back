The website should allow users to input their budget, receive personalized trip recommendations, and book their preferred trip.\n\nKey Features to Implement:\n\n\n\n**1- User Input for Budget:**\n\n- Create a clean and intuitive form where users can input their budget (in dollars or any currency).\n- Include a dropdown or input field for additional preferences (e.g., destination type: beach, mountain, city, etc.).\n\n\n**2- Trip Recommendations:**\n\nBased on the user\'s budget and preferences, display a list of trip recommendations.\n\n\n\nEach recommendation should include:\n\n- Destination name\n- Brief description\n- Estimated cost (flights, accommodation, activities)\n- A "Book Now" button\n\n\n**3- Dynamic Filtering:**\n\n- Your website must dynamically filter and display trips that fit within the user\'s budget.\n- If no trips are available within the budget, display a friendly message suggesting adjustments (e.g., "No trips found. Try increasing your budget or changing your preferences.").\n\n\n**4- Booking System:**\n\n- When a user clicks "Book Now," display a confirmation page with the trip details.\n- Include a simple form for the user to enter their contact information (name, email, phone number).\n- Show a success message after booking (e.g., "Thank you! Your trip to [Destination] has been booked.")\n\n.\n\n\n**5- Responsive Design:**\n\n- Ensure the website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.\n\n\n**Bonus Features (Optional):**\n\n\n- Include images for each destination to make the website more visually appealing.\n- Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.\n- Add a "Favorites" feature where users can save trips they like.\n- Implement a currency converter to display trip costs in different currencies.',

        'Learning to code from home has never been easier!\n\nYour task is to create a dynamic web application that allows users to learn programming languages from home by accessing curated playlists and videos for various programming topics. Each programming language (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Express.js, Python) will have multiple playlists and videos, complete with descriptions. Users can click on a video or playlist link to open it on YouTube. As a bonus, implement a search feature so users can quickly find the programming language or topic they want.\n\nKey Features to Implement:\n\n\n\n**1. Programming Language Sections:**\n\n- Create a homepage with different programming languages (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Express.js, Python).\n- Each language section should display a list of playlists and videos.\n\n\n**2.Playlists and Videos:**\n\nFor each playlist or video, include:\n\n- A title\n- A brief description (e.g., "Learn HTML basics in 30 minutes")\n- A thumbnail image (optional)\n- A link to the YouTube video or playlist\n- When the user clicks the link, it should open the video/playlist in a new tab.\n\n\n\n**3.Search Feature (Bonus):**\n\n- Add a search bar where users can type the name of a programming language or topic (e.g., "JavaScript" or "React").\n- Dynamically filter and display relevant playlists and videos based on the search query.\n\n**4.Responsive Design:**\n\n- Ensure the website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.\n\n\n\n**Bonus Features (Optional):**\n\n- Include a filter option to sort playlists by difficulty level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).\n- Add a "Favorites" feature where users can save their preferred playlists or videos.\n- Add a progress tracker for users to log their learning progress.\n- Implement a dark mode for better user experience.',

        'Want to create a cool online course that people actually enjoy? Static websites are great for simple stuff, but with a few tricks you can make your course way more engaging.\n\nHere\'s how:\n\n\n\n**1. Content That Appears When You Need It:**\n\nImagine your course has tons of lessons. Loading everything at once makes the page slow. Instead, load each lesson only when someone clicks on it.\n\n**- What it means:**\n\n Think of your course like a book with chapters. You don\'t read the whole book at once, right? This trick lets you load only the chapter someone wants to read, making the page super fast.\n\n\n**2. Fun and Interactive Stuff:**\n\nQuizzes are great for making learning fun! You can add cool interactive quizzes.\n\n**- What it means:**\n\n- Test users‚Äô knowledge on course topics with¬†multiple-choice questions.\n\n- Provide¬†instant feedback¬†after each question (e.g., "Correct! " or "Oops, try again!").\n\n- Calculate a¬†final score¬†at the end to show how well they performed.\n\n- Keep the design simple and user-friendly, ensuring it‚Äôs easy to navigate.\n\n- This quiz will make learning more engaging and help users track their progress in a fun way!\n\n\n\n**3. Works on Any Device:**\n\nPeople use phones, tablets, and computers. Your course should look great on all of them.\n\n**- What it means:**\n\n Imagine your course magically changing its size and layout to fit any screen. No more tiny text on phones or huge pictures on desktops. It just works, perfectly.\n\n\n**4. Easy to Get Around:**\n\nNobody likes getting lost. Your course should be easy to navigate.\n\n**- What it means:** \n\nImagine a clear menu, smooth transitions between lessons, and maybe even a search bar to find stuff quickly. It\'s all about making it easy for people to learn without getting frustrated.',
